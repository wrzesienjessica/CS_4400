identifier in alphabetical order should also be preferred.

to land, passengers allowed to disembark, and the time advanced by one hour until
the next takeoff to allow for preparations.

be allowed to board, and the time should be advanced to represent when the airplane
will land at its next location based on the leg distance and airplane speed.
